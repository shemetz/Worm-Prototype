offensive damaging pushing projectile cooldown aim cost
Create a ball of <e> and throw it with force towards a target.
Deals normal damage with an extra 1 pushback. 
Costs 1 M/s, while attacking.


Beam (Maintained) <Element>
offensive damaging pushing beam aim continuous-cost
Shoot a continuous beam of <e>.
Deals the same amount of damage but continuously (every 0.2 seconds, damage is damage*attackRate*0.04), instead of every X seconds. Hits immediately.
Costs 1 M/s while attacking.
NOTE:  Plant-Beams are completely different. Vines are shot, like an infinitely increasing line, until the person can't shoot anymore (lack of \mana) and they are destroyed, or when they latch onto a person. If the vine reaches its full range, it will retract.
When vines hit an enemy with their end they're "grabbling" it. While grabbling an enemy, there is a fixed-length vine stretching between the vine creator and the grabbled person.
Grabbled enemies are damaged by the vine at 0.5*points damage every 0.5 seconds. The vine now acts as a one-sided spring: When one of the people tries to move away from the vine, it stretches and draws them back, more strongly the more it stretches. The creator of the vine has increased control over the vine - they functionally have double the mass, in regards to pulling it. They are also able to move the vine sideways, virtually rotating the grabbled enemy around them (more easily the closer they are).
When a vine is dealt enough damage or the creator stops using it, it drops to the floor.

offensive damaging pushing continuous-cost range
Spray <e> in a wide arc in front of you, hitting many targets at once.
Deals half damage and half pushback on average, to every target in short range and a 120 degree arc. It acts like many short beams, randomly fluctuating and rotating in the field. Since the beams randomly rotate, it isn’t accurate and is not very useful against less than 3 targets.
Costs 1 M/s while attacking.


Strike (Activated) <Element>
offensive damaging pushing cost
